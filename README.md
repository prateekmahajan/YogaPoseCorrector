# Yoga Pose Corrector
It is a CMU based approach to Yoga Pose Correction in CVPR technology

Followed https://github.com/ildoonet/tf-pose-estimation and did changes respectively as per the requirements.

## Future work

* Improving accuracy of the algorithm. The algorithm fails when the background blends into the picture. 
* Algorithm used here is openpose mobilenet thin architecture, however larger more precise models can be used.
* With high power GPUs, the keypoint detection can be done in real-time and instructions can be provided on the go.

## Inspiration

Most exercises only work if they are done correctly, i.e in good form. This is why people insist on having personal trainers. However, during the COVID-19 pandemic most gyms were closed and exercises were done at home. This project is a very practical solution to analyse how a person exercises and is he/she doing it right.
